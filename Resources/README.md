# What is this?

This is the resources folder.

The resources in PluginResources are going to be copied to our plugin's folder, and the ones outside of it will be bundled with the dll at compile time.

There is one interesting resource called `shaderbundle`. It contains a unity AssetBundle which has 2 assets: a shader and a material which uses that shader. This is used for rendering hitboxes.

If you are curious on how to make such a bundle then feel free to message me on discord (username: `art0007i`)
