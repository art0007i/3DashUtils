# What is this?

This is the resources folder. It contains one file which is called "shaderbundle", but I guess you could have figured that out yourself.

The file is packaged with the dll during compile time. It contains a unity AssetBundle which has 2 assets: a shader and a material which uses that shader. This is used for rendering hitboxes.

If you are curious on how to make such a bundle then feel free to message me on discord (username: `art0007i`)
