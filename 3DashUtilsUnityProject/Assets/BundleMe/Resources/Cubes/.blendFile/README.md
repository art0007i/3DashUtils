This folder is hidden from unity because it contains a dot at the start.

I do this because importing blend files with unity directly is very unreliable as the blend format changes with each blender version.

The blend file was created using blender 3.4.0

For export settings I used the Wavefront (.obj) format and enabled "Limit to Selected Objects" and also "Triangulated Mesh" whenever necessary.
