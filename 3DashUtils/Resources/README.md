# What is this?

This is the resources folder.

The resources in PluginResources are going to be copied to our plugin's folder, and the ones outside of it will be bundled with the dll at compile time.

Currently we have 2 asset bundles (utilsAssets and utilsIconKit) which are compiled inside of the `3DashUtilsUnityProject` which is also part of this repository.
